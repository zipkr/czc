## A fuzzy file finder like fzf in c++

This is my first cpp project ever. Learning it as I go.
I am documenting my project as part of post I am planning to write. 
The article will be on Rust vs C++ for new devs but professional devs 2018 edition.

I am planning to write as my first project ever in each language as a fzf.
This is ideal for a few reasons. A fzf like binary examines the 5 most important things when evaluating a language.

1. Speed to completion of binary for a new user.
2. Library eco system (ncurses library)
3. Performance of binary
4. Which one did I enjoy more?
5. Can I get paid doing this?
